# With TypeScript

This example shows how `@prismicio/react` is used in TypeScript projects. `@prismicio/react` is written in TypeScript using types from [`@prismicio/types`](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-types).

You can write types for your documents using `PrismicDocument`. Components from `@prismicio/react` will type check against your document and its fields.
